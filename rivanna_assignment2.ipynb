    "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about? **This paper discusses the ways a data scientist can efficiently clean or \"tidy\" data, which can lead to more accurate - and fun - data analysis**\n",
    " 2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish? **The \"tidy data standard\" is intended to provide data scientists a framework through which they can clean data. With this algorithmic approach to cleaning data, people wouldn't have to worry about figuring out where to start when it comes to cleaning data, they simply follow the tidy data standard**\n",
    " 3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" **This means that messy datasets often have a unique problem that makes them messy, which therefore complicates the cleaning process for someone who has never encountered that specific problem before** What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\" **Oftentimes, having to isolate a given variable/observation in a way in which a computer can understand is difficult and frustrating, especially when as a human our brains automatically can detect a problem fairly quickly.**\n",
    " 4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations? **Values are defined as a collection of quantitative numbers or qualitative strings. Variables are defined as values that measure the same underlying attribute across units, such as height, temp., etc. An observation however measures all values on the same unit across attributes.**\n",
    " 5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3? **A \"tidy\" data set's variables will each form a column, each observation will form a row, and the type of observational unit will form a table**\n",
    " 6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? **The five most common problems with messy datasets are: 1. Column headers are values and not variable names 2. Multiple variables are stoerd in one column 3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns 4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table 5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.** Why are the data in Table 4 messy? **The data are messy because there are variables that can be condensed into one column, rather than spread out throughout the table.** What is \"melting\" a dataset? **\"Melting\" a dataset is whenever we stack variables and observations that are redudantly placed across a table. This allows for a more condensed and easy-to-read table.**\n",
    " 7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"? **Table 11 is messy because there is a column for each possible day in the month, which can be combined with the year and month column in order to create one condensed column. Meanwhile table 12 does this and creates a singular variable called \"date\". Additionally table 12 has two columns that distinct that maximum and minimum temperature on a given date, making the information more tidy and easy to understand**\n",
    " 8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? **The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem is that if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data. This means that we might find ourself spending time on organizing the tidy data tools themselves rather than the explicit data on-hand...** What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling? **Wickham hopes that others will build upon this tidy data framework and design new tools/methodologies in which one can effectively organize data**"
